                    1944â€“45. He joined anti-Soviet resistance, advancing from a platoon commander to the chairman of the
                    Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters. From 1952 he lived in hiding with fake papers. Ramanauskas was
                    the last partisan commander to be captured. Betrayed, he was arrested, tortured, and eventually executed
                    by KGB.</p>
